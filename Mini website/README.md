# Variance Components in Digital PCR - Mini website

In this mini-website, we provide an interactive tool to study the influence of specific sources of variation on the performance of the concentration estimators. This can serve as a guide when designing an experiment. All results are relative to the true concentration and based on 1000 simulations with 8 technical replicates.
